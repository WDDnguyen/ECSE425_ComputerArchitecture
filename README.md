# McGill ECSE425 Computer Architecture And Organization Winter 2017
Code is available for anyone to use as reference.
All deliverables written in VHDL and tested with ModelSim-Altera 10.1d.

## Project Deliverables
- Deliverable 1 : Create a Finite State Machine to detect a comment in a string with the format /* */.
- Deliverable 2 : Implemented a 2-stage arighmetic operation.
- Deliverable 3 : Created a Finite State Machine write-back cache with Avalon interface to interact with  a Main Memory
- Deliverable 4 : Designed a 5-stage pipelined processor based on a subset of the MIPS ISA.
- Deliverable 5 : Deliverable 4 processor by applying unified cache and split cache optimizations 

## Running Deliverable programs
To compile programs, open ModelSim and change the directory(File, Change Directory) to the folder that contain the files to run. In the Transcript section (ModelSim console), run the following command on the .tcl file of the directory :

```
Source "tcl_file_to_run".tcl
```
This will compile and display the necessary waves to see the results.
